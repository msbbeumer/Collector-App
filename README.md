# Collector-App

This app was built based on the "Homepwner" app from the Big Nerd Ranch Guide to iOS Programming, 6th edition

It is modified to be useful for collectors rather than homeowners and there have been other slight modifications in the way 
that it displays and allows changes to the items in the collector's "Collection"

This is a very basic level app and I am publishing it here primarily to practice using Github with XCode

Cheers
